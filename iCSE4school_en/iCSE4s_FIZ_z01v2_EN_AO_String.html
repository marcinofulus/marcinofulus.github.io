<p>This lesson is addressed to students of age 17, learning at advanced
level. It fulfills the following requirements included in National
Curriculum:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>General requirement V: “planning and executing simple experiments
and analyzing their results”.</p></li>
<li><p>Detailed requirement 6.8: “student uses in calculations the
relations between wave parameters: length, frequency, period and
velocity”</p></li>
<li><p>Detailed requirement 6.12: “student describes standing waves and
their dependence on waves running backwardly”.</p></li>
<li><p>Intersection requirement 12.2: “student single-handedly makes correct graphs”.</p></li>
<li><p>Intersection requirement 12.5: “student fits a straight line y = ax + b to the graph and calculates the coefficients a and b”.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental requirement 13.6: “student examines string vibrations (for example the dependence of frequency on the length), does the measurements, description, data analysis and graph interpretation”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The described topic is a simple example of a perfect integration science with IT and teaching English. Therefore it must be carried out both in computer laboratory, physics laboratory and English class-room.</p>

<h2>IT Part<a class="headerlink" href="#it-part" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The experimental lesson must be preceded by a basic course of Python,
including drawing and formatting graphs and fitting functions to
measuring points. Polish National Curriculum requires only fitting
straight lines y = ax + b and counting the coefficients a
and b. Python allows to fit any curve without any effort, so it is a
good opportunity to play with hyperbola. The additional skills needed
to complete the homework assigned at the end of experimental lesson
are: formatting text in SageMath, inserting pictures and making tables in
the text. It is advisable to perform with students the following
exercises:</p>

<h2>Experimental Part<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-part" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the beginning the teacher ask pupils to recall the ideas of
standing waves, frequency, wave length and phase velocity. Next, he
derives the formula <em>f</em> ( <em>l</em> ), where <em>l</em> is the length of string. It
shows, that this two variables are inversely proportional. Checking
this dependence is the main aim of this lesson.</p>
<p>Next, students are divided into groups. Each group chooses one
instrument. It may be a string stretched on a ruler, string stretched
on a resonance box or any real music string instrument. Groups move
far away each from other to minimize the mutual disturbance.</p>
<p>In each group somebody is responsible for putting the string into
vibrations. Simultaneously, somebody else generates sound using
software generator. It has a property of fluent adjusting the
frequency. When the group judge, that the tone coming out from the
loudspeaker is the same as from the string, they note the length of
string and frequency. This measurement is repeated for different
length of the oscillator, in the most possible range. Alternatively,
students may make independent measurements, using software
applications in their smartphones.</p>
<p>All collected data are noted in a table in notebooks. Students are
encouraged to make photos. The teacher announces, that this data and
photos will be used in a homework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="homework">
<h2>Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Write in SageMath a short report of the executed experiment, including
description of the essence of the matter, measuring system (with
photo), used tools, performed activities, obtained results and
inferences. In particular, the report should prove or refute the
hypothesis, that frequency of vibrations is reciprocally proportional
to the length of string.</p>
<p>The data are shared for the whole groups, but all reports must be
independent and individual. The authors of best reports will have the
right to translate their works into English and publish them, gaining
additional points for it. English teachers are ready to assist and
supervise pupils in translation.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Report<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation-report" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The second edition of the lesson <em>Examining String Vibrations</em> was
accomplished 5th April 2016 (both IT and experimental parts). Students
were divided into 5 groups of four people each. One girl brought her
own violin, somebody else used her own guitar. The remaining 3 groups
were equipped with instruments from my laboratory, i.e. a string
stretched on resonance box and two strings stretched on a ruler. All
groups were equipped with software acoustic generators and
applications measuring the dominant frequency of heared sound. Some
groups stayed in the classroom, whereas the others went to corridor to
carry out their measurements far away from noises generated by other
groups.</p>
<p>After tentative calculations it occurred, that 4 groups succeeded in
their measurements, whereas one encountered disturbances by voices
coming from the neighbor group. They asked me to repeat this
experiment during additional classes. Finally, all students obtained
reasonable results and wrote quite good reports.</p>
<p>After two weeks we met again in the IT laboratory. By this time I had
made a preliminary assessments of the works. I explained my remarks
and advised, what could be improved. After next week I set the final
assessments. Five works got the highest grades and moved on to the
second step. Their authors were granted a possibility to translate the
works into English and publish them for extra points. Earlier I asked
English teacher for cooperation. They supervised the translations and
also made their own assessments of the language. All the awarded
homeworks are published at sage01 server.</p>
<p>This lesson was a great success. Students liked it very much. I
managed to integrate physics not only with IT, but also with
English. Language teachers appreciated my initiative and reported,
that it was an interesting experience both for them and for the
students. They teach a subject called <em>technical English for
engineers</em> and this was its live, practical application.</p>
<p>I will not describe the individual student’s conclusions, because they
are all included in the original works.</p>
