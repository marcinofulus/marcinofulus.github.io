Lesson Plan
-----------


Based on the book C. Quinn, C. Sangwin, R. Haese. M. Haese,
"Mathematics for the international student. Mathematics HL (Option):
Calculus, Haese and Harris Publications 2013.

We will only consider differential equations of the form:

:math:`\normalsize f(x,y) \Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize +g(x,y)=0`, where  :math:`\normalsize y=y(x)`.

These are known as first order differential equations since there is only one derivative in the equation, and it is a first derivative.

**A function**   :math:`y=y(x)`  **is said to be a solution**  of a differential equation if it satisfies the differential equation for all values of  :math:`x`  **  in the domain of  :math:`y` .

Slope Fields
------------

Given any first order differential equation of the form  :math:`\normalsize f(x,y) \Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize +g(x,y)=0`, where  :math:`\normalsize y=y(x)`  we can write

:math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-g(x,y)}{f(x,y)}\normalsize =h(x,y)`

We may therefore deduce the gradient of the solution curves to the differential equation at any point  :math:`(x,y)`in the plane where  :math:`h(x,y)`is defined, and hence the equations of the tangents to the solution curves.

**The set of tangents at all points  :math:`(x,y)` is called the slope field of the differential equation** .

By representing the gradients at many different grid points as line segments, we obtain a slope field of the tangents to the solution curves. Now the tangent to a curve approximates that curve at and near the points of tangency. Therefore, by following the direction given by the slope field at a given point, we can approximate solution curves of the differential equation.

 ***Example 1*** 

Consider the differential equation  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize =x(y-1)`.

a) Construct the slope field using integer grid points for  :math:`x, y \in [-4, 4]`.

b) Sketch the particular solution curve through  :math:`P(1, 2)`. Sketch the particular solution curves through several other points of your choice \- adjust the parameters of the graph respectively.

c) An  **isocline**  is the set of all points on a slope field at which the tangents to the solution curves have the same gradient. Identify any isoclines on your slope fields.

**EXERCISES**

Using SAGE solve the following problems. You can modify the procedure given above or write your own.

1. Consider the differential equation  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize =2x-y`.

a) Find the general solution to the differential equation.

b) Construct the slope field of the differential equation.

c) Find the solution curve which passes through  :math:`P(0, 1)` and its equation.

2. Consider the differential equation  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize =10y \tan(x)`, where  :math:`x` is measured in degrees. Draw the slope field using integer grid points, where  :math:`x, y \in [-2, 2]`.

3. Draw the slope field for the differential equation  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize  = \Large \frac{-1+x^2+4y^2}{y-5x+10}`.

a) Sketch the particular solution curve passing through the origin.

b) Sketch the isocline corresponding to:

(i)  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx}` being undefined.

(ii)  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize =0`.



Separable Differential Equations
--------------------------------

Differential equations which can be written in the form  :math:`\large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = \large \frac{f(x)}{g(y)}`, where  :math:`y=y(x)`, are known as separable differential equations.

We can notice that if  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = \Large \frac{f(x)}{g(y)}`, then  :math:`\normalsize g(y) \Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = f(x)`. Now, integrating both sides of the equation with respect to  :math:`x` we get  :math:`\large \int g(y) \large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize dx =\int f(x)dx` and by the Chain Rule we can reduce the problem of solving the differential equation to the problem of finding two separate integrals

.. math::

   \large \int g(y)dy =\int f(x)dx

   
***Example 2:*** 

Find the general solution of the differential equation  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = \Large \frac{x^2y+y}{x^2-1}`. Verify your results with SAGE and sketch the solution curve passing through the point  :math:`P(x_0, y_0)` if:

a)  :math:`(x_0, y_0) = (2,3)`

b)  :math:`(x_0, y_0) = (0,0)`

c)  :math:`(x_0, y_0) = (-2,1)`

***Solution:*** 


.. sagecellserver::

    sage: x, x0, y0 = var('x x0 y0')
    sage: y = function('y', x)
    sage: de = diff(y,x) == (x^2*y+y)/(x^2-1)
    sage: general = desolve(de, y)
    sage: html('General solution of the equation is $y=$'"$%s$"%latex(general) + '.' + "$")
    sage: x0 = -2
    sage: y0 = 1
    sage: particular = desolve(de, [y,x], [x0, y0]).simplify()
    sage: html('The particular solution of the equation is $y=$'"$%s$"%latex(particular) + '.' + "$")
    sage: p1 = plot (particular, x, xmin = -3, xmax = 4, ymin = -10, ymax = 10, axes_labels=['$x$','$f(x)$'], exclude = [-1], detect_poles = 'show', figsize = (6, 4), color = 'blue', legend_label="$y =$ $%s$"%latex(particular))

**EXERCISES**

1. Solve the following initial value problems:

a)  :math:`(2-x)\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = 1`,   :math:`y(4) = 3`.

b)  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize - 3x \sec(x) = 0`,   :math:`y(1) = 0`.

c)  :math:`e^y(2x^2 + 4x +1)\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = (x+1)(e^y +3)`,   :math:`y(0)=2`.

d)  :math:`x \Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = \cos^2(y)`,   :math:`y(e) = \large \frac {\pi}{4}`.

2. Solve  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = \Large \frac{3y-xy}{x^2-1}`,   :math:`y(0) = 1`.



Homogeneous Differential Equations
----------------------------------

Differential equations of the form  :math:`\large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = f\large \left ( \frac{y}{x} \right)`, where  :math:`\normalsize y=y(x)` are known as homogeneous differential equations .

They can be solved using the substitution  :math:`y=vx`, where  :math:`v=v(x)`. The substitution will always reduce the differential equation to a separable differentiable equation.

 

***Example 3:***

Use the substitution  :math:`y=vx`, where  :math:`v=v(x)`, to find general solution of the differential equation  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize = \Large \frac{x+2y}{x}`. Verify your results with SAGE and find the particular solution if  :math:`y=\large \frac{3}{2}` when  :math:`x=3`.

    sage: y = function('y',x)
    sage: de = (diff(y,x) == (x+2*y)/x)

    sage: html('General solution of the equation is $y=$'"$%s$"%latex(general) + '.' + "$")
    sage: particular = desolve(de, [y,x], [3,1.5]).expand()

The Integrating Factor Method
-----------------------------

Suppose a first order linear differential equation is of the form  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize +P(x)y=Q(x)`, where  :math:`\normalsize y=y(x)`.

1. Calculate the integrating factor  :math:`I(x) = e^ {\int P(x)dx}`. You do not need a constant of integration.

2. Multiply the differential equation through by  :math:`I(x)`.

3. Simplify the LHS and hence obtain  :math:`I(x)y=\int I(x)Q(x)dx +C`, where  :math:`C` is a constant.

4. Integrate to obtain the general solution.

***Example 4:***

Solve the differential equation  :math:`\Large \frac{dy}{dx} \normalsize +3x^2y=6x^2`. Find the particular solution of the equation for the initial condition  :math:`y(0) = 1`.

 ***Solution:*** 


.. sagecellserver::

    sage: var('x y C')
    sage: var('dy,dx')
    sage: var('x0 y0')
    sage: Y = function('Y', x)
    sage: de = diff(Y,x) + 3*x^2*Y == 6*x^2
    sage: I = e^(integral(3*x^2, x)) #integrating factor
    sage: html('1. The integrating factor of the equation is $I(x)=$' "$%s$"%latex(I) + '.' + "$")
    sage: de1 = ((I*de).subs({diff(Y,x):dy/dx,Y:y})*dx).full_simplify().expand()
    sage: html('2. Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor ' "$%s$"%latex(I) + ' we get ' "$%s$"%latex(de1) + '.' + "$")
    sage: RHS = integral(de1.rhs(),x).coefficient(dx) # RHS.show()
    sage: LHS = y*I
    sage: html('3. Taking integrals on both sides of the equation we get: ')
    sage: eqn = (LHS == RHS + C)
    sage: eqn.show()
    sage: solution = solve(eqn, y)[0].expand()
    sage: html('4. Therefore, general solution of the equation is ' "$%s$"%latex(solution) + '.' + "$")
    sage: x0 = 0
    sage: y0 = 1
    sage: particular = desolve(de, [Y,x], [x0,y0]).expand()
