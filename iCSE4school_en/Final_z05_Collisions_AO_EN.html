<h2>Description of the problem<a class="headerlink" href="#description-of-the-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The experiment presented in this document has been accomplished during facultative activities and has the status of optional task. Interested pupils might conduct it, film it and describe in a report, additionally evaluated.</p>
<p>The task is to analyze a central collision of 2 bodies of known masses on air truck. The original gliders of air track were equipped with elastic metal bumpers. Because I noticed, that during collisions part of the energy dissipates, causing permanent deformations of bumpers, I replaced them by repelling neodymium magnets. One can expect, that now the collisions will be perfectly elastic, so that both momentum and kinetic energy will be conserved. Such experiment gives also opportunity for detailed investigation the nature of magnetic forces.</p>
<p>Collisions lasted about 3 seconds and were filmed using HD cameras. Exemplary film is available here: <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/JSpKctrX_YM">https://youtu.be/JSpKctrX_YM</a></p>
<p>The pupil’s task was to read out (frame by frame) positions of both gliders from the air track’s scale. There were a few gliders to choose from, each of different mass. The variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_2\)</span> denote coordinates of the ends of gliders’ grounds turned to each other. The magnets glued to gliders jutted by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_2\)</span>, so that the distance between poles was less from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|x_2-x_1|\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_1+d_2\)</span>. The set of experimental data was the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gliders’ masses: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_2\)</span> from about 0,17 kg to over 0,4 kg</p></li>
<li><p>Sizes of magnets and their fastening: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_2\)</span>, about 0,01 m</p></li>
<li><p>Time was calculated iteratively and, depending on the camera, was increasing with the step 1/25 s or 1/30 s</p></li>
<li><p>Gliders’ coordinates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1(t)\)</span> i <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_2(t)\)</span> red out from the film and expressed in meters. If gliders were moving towards decreasing values on the scale, their velocities and momentums were negative.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the basis of above data, one should draw and interpret the following charts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1(t)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_2(t)\)</span> - gliders’ positions as a function of time.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_1(t)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_2(t)\)</span> - gliders’ instantaneous velocities in particular frames. When points of charts created a chaotic cloud (data noising), I advised to take averages from 2 neighbor frames.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_1(t), p_2(t)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_c(t)\)</span> - momentums of particular gliders and the whole system. One should check, whether the total momentum was conserved.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_1(t), E_2(t)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_c(t)\)</span> - gliders’ kinetic energies and their sum. One should check, whether the total kinetic energy was conserved.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_1(t)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_2(t)\)</span> - gliders’ accelerations.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_1(t)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_2(t)\)</span> - forces applied to gliders.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(r)\)</span> - dependence of magnetic force on the distance between poles.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In October 2016 the whole group of next pupils age-group filmed their collisions. They tried to investigate different cases, varying the gliders’ masses, values and senses of velocity or putting one glider motionless (as a target).

<p>I will add only, that I do not share all the presented there final conclusions. Furthermore, in my opinion, the author quite unnecessary fitted 12th degree polynomials to the charts of velocity. I do not know, what was it for.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The presented experiment was one of most interesting in my professional career. Because of the multiplicity of different situations (arbitrary velocities, more gliders to choose, one could obtain quite different results. Students had freedom in drawing conclusions, it was their independed research work. For example, in the quoted work, at the chart of kinetic energy there is an evident minimum at the moment of closest approach of gliders. Student interpretent it as a measuring error caused by too rapid change of speeds. In my opinion, it is a moment, when kinetic energy partially remolded into energy of magnetic interactions. But why, in such case, there is also a visible small breakdown at the total momentum chart?</p>
<p>This experiment basically pertained to pure mechanics, but by the way it gave an opportunity to explore the nature of magnetic force. Students could fit any curves to the chart <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(r)\)</span> - I did not impose ready solutions. One should look at the data and figure out, what type of curve will be the most suitable.</p>
<p>How it can be seen from above analysis, the precision in reading out the positions of gliders at individual frames, is essential. It is not easy and requires use of good camera. The data noise may be partially removed, but it decreases the resolution, in which we see the whole phenomenon.</p>
<p>The added value of the whole enterprise was a fruitful cooperation with English teachers. They supervised translations done by authors of the best homeworks. Students in science profile classes realize an additional subject called <em>English for engineers</em>. Experiment in physics created opportunity to exercise technical language on living example and get additional assessment for it.</p>
