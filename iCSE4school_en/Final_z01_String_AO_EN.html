<ul class="simple">
<li><p>General requirement V: “planning and executing simple experiments and analyzing their results”.</p></li>
<li><p>Detailed requirement 6.8: “student uses in calculations the relations between wave parameters: length, frequency, period and velocity”</p></li>
<li><p>Detailed requirement 6.12: “student describes standing waves and their dependence on waves running backwardly”.</p></li>
<li><p>Intersection requirement 12.2: “student single-handedly makes correct graphs”.</p></li>
<li><p>Intersection requirement 12.5: “student fits a straight line y = ax + b to the graph and calculates the coefficients a and b”.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental requirement 13.6: “student examines string vibrations (for example the dependence of frequency on the length), does the measurements, description, data analysis and graph interpretation”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The described topic is a simple example of a perfect integration science with IT and teaching English. Therefore it must be carried out both in computer laboratory, physics laboratory and English class-room.</p>

<h2>IT Part<a class="headerlink" href="#it-part" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The experimental lesson must be preceded by a basic course of Python, including drawing and formatting graphs and fitting functions to measuring points. Polish National Curriculum requires only fitting straight lines y = ax + b and counting the coefficients a and b. Python allows to fit any curve without any effort, so it is a good opportunity to play with hyperbola. The additional skills needed to complete the homework assigned at the end of experimental lesson are: formatting text in SAGE, inserting pictures and making tables in the text. It is advisable to perform with students the following exercises:</p>

<h2>Experimental Part<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-part" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the beginning the teacher ask pupils to recall the ideas of
standing waves, frequency, wave length and phase velocity. Next, he
derives the formula <em>f</em> ( <em>l</em> ), where <em>l</em> is the length of string. It
shows, that this two variables are inversely proportional. Checking
this dependence is the main aim of this lesson.</p>
<p>Next, students are divided into groups. Each group chooses one
instrument. It may be a string stretched on a ruler, string stretched
on a resonance box or any real music string instrument. Groups move
far away each from other to minimize the mutual disturbance.</p>
<p>In each group somebody is responsible for putting the string into
vibrations. Simultaneously, somebody else generates sound using
software generator. It has a property of fluent adjusting the
frequency. When the group judge, that the tone coming out from the
loudspeaker is the same as from the string, they note the length of
string and frequency. This measurement is repeated for different
length of the oscillator, in the most possible range. Alternatively,
students may make independent measurements, using software
applications in their smartphones.</p>
<p>All collected data are noted in a table in notebooks. Students are
encouraged to make photos. The teacher announces, that this data and
photos will be used in a homework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="homework">
<h2>Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Write in SAGE a short report of the executed experiment, including
description of the essence of the matter, measuring system (with
photo), used tools, performed activities, obtained results and
inferences. In particular, the report should prove or refute the
hypothesis, that frequency of vibrations is reciprocally proportional
to the length of string.</p>
<p>The data are shared for the whole groups, but all reports must be
independent and individual. The authors of best reports will have the
right to translate their works into English and publish them, gaining
additional points for it. English teachers are ready to assist and
supervise pupils in translation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evaluation-report">
<h2>Evaluation Report<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation-report" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At first time this lesson was carried out in the spring 2015. All
students made the same measurement. The whole group (14 person) is
visible in the above picture. All homeworks were based on the same set
of data, but I asked students to work individually at home and create
unique reports. In fact, obtained reports differed in level and tools
used. Students usually admitted, that using Sage helped them
much. They discovered that Sage is a convenient environment for that
tasks.</p>
<p>The second edition of the lesson <em>Examining String Vibrations</em> was
accomplished 5-th April 2016 (both IT and experimental
parts). Students were divided into 5 groups of four people each. One
girl brought her own violin, somebody else used her own guitar. The
remaining 3 groups were equipped with instruments from my laboratory,
i.e. a string stretched on resonance box and two strings stretched on
a ruler. All groups were equipped with software acoustic generators
and applications measuring the dominant frequency of heared
sound. Some groups stayed in the classroom, whereas the others went to
corridor to carry out their measurements far away from noises
generated by other groups.</p>
<p>After tentative calculations it occurred, that 4 groups succeeded in their measurements, whereas one encountered disturbances by voices coming from the neighbor group. They asked me to repeat this experiment during additional classes. Finally, all students obtained reasonable results and wrote quite good reports.</p>
<p>After two weeks we met again in the IT laboratory. By this time I had made a preliminary assessments of the works. I explained my remarks and advised, what could be improved. After next week I set the final assessments. Five works got the highest grades and moved on to the second step. Their authors were granted a possibility to translate the works into English and publish them for extra points. Earlier I asked English teacher for cooperation. They supervised the translations and also made their own assessments of the language. All the awarded homeworks are published at sage01 server.</p>
<p>This lesson was a great success. Students liked it very much. I managed to integrate physics not only with IT, but also with English. Language teachers appreciated my initiative and reported, that it was an interesting experience both for them and for the students. They teach a subject called   <em>technical English for engineers</em> and this was its live, practical application.</p>
<p>I will not describe the individual student’s conclusions, because they are all included in the original works.</p>
<p>The last edition (in April 2017) was the most successfull. Next generation of students became skilled in attaching errorbars to graphs, using Numpy library. Some of them brought their own professional music equipment and made really serious scientific investigation. Like one year earlier, I qualified the best works for translation, which students did on their own perfect. The best homeworks are attached in separate files.</p>
