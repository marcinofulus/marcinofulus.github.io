    We will present a series of population models, each of which is
    applicable to different environmental circumstances. We start with the
    simplest models: one population. Next, we can complicate models by
    adding influence of various factors from environment.

    Mathematical modeling is based on properties of functions and their
    derivatives. The quantity that determines the change rate of the
    function N(t) is its derivative :math:`\displaystyle\frac{dN(t)}{dt}`. If
    :math:`\displaystyle\frac{dN(t)}{dt}> 0`, the function :math:`N(t)` increases if the
    argument :math:`t` increases. On contrary, if :math:`\displaystyle\frac{dN(t)}{dt}<0`, the
    function :math:`N(t)` decreases if :math:`t`, increases. It is sufficient information to
    start the modeling.
