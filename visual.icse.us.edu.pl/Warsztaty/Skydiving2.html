<h1>Skydiving - part 2<a class="headerlink" href="Skydiving2.html#skydiving-part-2" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h1>
<p>In part 1 we created a program to solve the equations of motion for
skydiving. We began with Newtons 2nd law, and we looked at the forces
acting on the jumper. This gave us a formula for the acceleration as a
function of the velocity. Then we used the equations of motion that we
know hold for constant acceleration to find the velocity at small steps
forward in time.</p>
<p>In this part we will do the same for the position, and we will use a
bungee jumper as an example. The only thing that differs between
skydiving and bungee jumping is the formula for acceleration. Everything
else is exactly the same. But because the forces acting on the bungee
jumper is dependent on the position of the jumper, we have to solve for
the position as well.</p>
<p>After this we will plot the g-forces for both the skydiver and the
bungee jumper. Then we can compare skydiving and bungee jumping based on
the g-forces experienced by the jumper. We will also look at how the
parachute deploys and the effect it has on the g-forces.</p>
<p>In part 1, we began by finding the following expression for the
acceleration of a skydiver:</p>
<div class="math">
\[a(v) = g - \frac{1}{2}C\rho A v^2.\]</div>
<p>Then we used the equations of motion for constant acceleration</p>
<div class="math">
\[v = v_0 + a t\]</div>
<p>to take short steps in time of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>, which gave us</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align*}
v_1 &amp;= v_0 + a(v_0)\Delta t \\
v_2 &amp;= v_1 + a(v_1)\Delta t \\
v_3 &amp;= v_2 + a(v_2)\Delta t \\
&amp;\vdots \\
v_{i+1} &amp;= v_i + a(v_i)\Delta t.
\end{align*}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>But there is a corresponding equation for constant acceleration which we
can use to find the position:</p>
<div class="math">
\[x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2.\]</div>
<p>We can use this to take short &#8216;steps in time&#8217; in the same way as we did
for the velocity</p>
<div class="section" id="bungee-jump">
<h2>Bungee jump<a class="headerlink" href="Skydiving2.html#bungee-jump" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let us examine a bungee jumper and the forces acting on her. We can
regard the elastic cord as similar to a stretched spring. But unlike a
spring, the cord does not exert any force when it is compressed, only
when it is stretched. When the jumper jumps from the top of a bridge,
the cord is not stretched, and so it does not affect the jumper until
she has fallen far enough for the cord to begin to stretch. This point,
right before the elastic cord starts to stretch, is known as the point
of equilibrium</p>
<p>Now, let us create a reference that fits the problem we are examining.
We place <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> at the point of equilibrium, and we decide that the
cord is 20 meters long, so our jumper jumps from a point 20 meters above
the the point of equilibrium, that is at <span class="math">\(x_0 = 20\)</span>m. Let us add
a river 60 meters below the bridge.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="bungee jumper illustration" src="_images/Bungee_bridge.svg" /><p class="caption">bungee jumper illustration</p>
</div>
<p>We can tell that if the jumpers position is above the point of
equilibrium, then the cord will not be stretched, and it will not act on
the jumper with any force. And because we have placed the point of
equilibrium at <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>, the force exerted by the cord <span class="math">\(S\)</span>
equals <span class="math">\(0\)</span> for <span class="math">\(x&gt;0\)</span>.</p>
<p>If, instead, we have <span class="math">\(x&lt;0\)</span>, we can see that the cord is stretched,
and so it will pull the jumper upwards with a spring force. We can model
this force with the help of a principle known as Hooke&#8217;s law. Hooke&#8217;s
law states that the force from a spring that is stretched a length of
<span class="math">\(x\)</span> is given by:</p>
<div class="math">
\[F = -kx,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is a constant dependent on the stiffness of the spring.</p>
<p>Now we can express the force from the cord as a function of the position
<span class="math">\(x\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}S(x) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \mbox{if } x&gt;0 \\
-kx &amp; \mbox{if } x \leq 0
\end{cases}.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In addition to <span class="math">\(S(x)\)</span>, the jumper experiences both gravity mg, and
air resistance <span class="math">\(Dv\)</span>. From Newtons 2nd law:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sum F = ma,\]</div>
<p>so then</p>
<div class="math">
\[S(x) - mg - Dv = ma.\]</div>
<p>if we solve this for the acceleration, we get a function dependent on
both the velocity and position of the jumper.</p>
<div class="math">
\[a(x,v) = \frac{S(x)}{m} - g - \frac{D}{m}v.\]</div>
<p>This means that we have to solve for both velocity and position at the
same time, like this</p>

elastic, pulling upwards, cancel each other out. After oscillating up

<div class="section" id="plotting-g-forces">
<h2>Plotting g-forces<a class="headerlink" href="Skydiving2.html#plotting-g-forces" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>The term &#8216;g-force&#8217; is somewhat misleading because it is not really a
&#8216;force&#8217; you experience, but <em>acceleration</em>. When the human body is
accelerated, we feel it as weight pulling at us. Like when you are
sitting in a car that drives through a turn. You feel like you are
beeing pulled to the side. So these accelerations feels like a force
acting on the body, and that is why we call them &#8216;g-forces&#8217;.</p>
<p>The letter &#8216;g&#8217; in &#8216;g-force&#8217; stands for gravitation. This is because we
compare the force we feel with the gravitational force. When you are
standing perfectly still, you feel 1 g from gravity. During a roller
coaster ride you will, as the ride progresses, experience a lot of
different g-forces when you are accelerating up and down the hills,
trough turns and possibly even through loops. You become weightless when
there is a quick dive down from a peak in the roller coaster, that is,
you experience 0 g or free-fall. An advantage with using g-forces is
that they are independent from mass. This means that every person will
feel the exact same g-forces during the same roller coaster.</p>
<p>To calculate the g-forces experienced by the jumper in both cases, we
just need to add an additional array to the loop. For this array, we
calculate the acceleration acting on the jumper, divide by <span class="math">\(g\)</span> and
add 1. Here is the code:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>gforces = zeros(N+1)
...


for i in range(N):
    t[i+1] = t[i] + ...
    v[i+1] = v[i] + ...
    x[i+1] = x[i] + ...
    gforces[i] = a(x[i],v[i])/g + 1</script></div></div>
<div class="section" id="exercise">
<h2>Exercise<a class="headerlink" href="Skydiving2.html#exercise" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>Calculate and plot the g-forces that act on both the skydiver and the
bungee jumper in your program. Compare the plots, are they different
from each other? Try to explain why the two are different.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deploying-the-parachute">
<h2>Deploying the parachute<a class="headerlink" href="Skydiving2.html#deploying-the-parachute" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>Finally the time has come to deploy our simulated parachute. As we
mentioned previously, we only have to change the drag coefficient
<span class="math">\(C\)</span> to <span class="math">\(C_P = 1.8\)</span> and the silhouette area <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(A_P = 44\)</span>. Earlier we simulated the jump for <span class="math">\(T = 60\)</span>
seconds. Now we will increase the time to <span class="math">\(180\)</span> seconds, but let
the first loop still iterate only over the first <span class="math">\(60\)</span> seconds.
Then we change <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and solve the remaining
<span class="math">\(120\)</span> seconds.</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>dt = 0.01
T = 180
n = int(T/dt)

# Simulating the first 60 seconds
for i in range(0, 60/dt):
    t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
    v[i+1] = v[i] + a(v[i])*dt
    gforces[i] = 1 - a(v[i])/g

# Change C and A
C = C_p
A = A_p

# Simulationg the last 120 seconds
for i in range(60/dt, 180/dt):
    t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
    v[i+1] = v[i] + a(v[i])*dt
    gforces[i] = 1 - a(v[i])/g</script></div><p>Now, we can plot the velocity against time, and the g-forces. What do we
see? One problem that has materialized is that the change in the values
of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> happens far to sudden. It is like the
parachute deployed immediately, which would have slowed the jumper
extremely fast, causing almost 100 g! Anything above 10g can be fatal,
and an average person will start to faint above 5g. It does not look
good for our poor parachute jumper!</p>
<p>This is why modern parachutes are made to deploy slower on purpose, so
the velocity decreases slower. Let us attempt to simulate that the
parachute takes 5 seconds to deploy completely, and see how it affects
the g-forces. This time, we create three loops. One without a parachute,
one where the parachute is in the process of deploying, and one after
the parachute is completely deployed.</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>dt = 0.01
T = 180
n = int(T/dt)

# Simulating the first 60 seconds
for i in range(0, 60/dt):
    t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
    v[i+1] = v[i] + a(v[i])*dt
    gforces[i] = 1 - a(v[i])/g

# Simulating the next 5 seconds
for i in range(60/dt, 65/dt):
    C += (C_p-C)/(5/dt)
    A += (A_p-A)/(5/dt)

    t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
    v[i+1] = v[i] + a(v[i])*dt
    gforces[i] = 1 - a(v[i])/g

# Simulationg the last 120 seconds
for i in range(65/dt, 180/dt):
    t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
    v[i+1] = v[i] + a(v[i])*dt
    gforces[i] = 1 - a(v[i])/g</script></div></div>
