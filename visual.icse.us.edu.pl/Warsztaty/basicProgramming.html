<h2>What is computer programming?<a class="headerlink" href="basicProgramming.html#what-is-computer-programming" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>Programming simply to create computer programs. We are surrounded by
computer programs (or software) everywhere. For instance Microsoft Word,
Mozilla Firefox and Photoshop. Other examples are all the apps you have
installed on your smart phone. These examples are usually large complex
programs, but most computer programs are much simpler and you will write
your first program very soon if you continue reading.</p>
<p>To understand how programming works from a bird eye view you can play a
game called <a class="reference external" href="http://lightbot.com/hocflash.html">Lightbot</a>. The game
is pretty self explainatory, so make sure you follow the instructions
carefully! When programming it is extremely important to be precise.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Could explain more!</p>
<p>A computer program is written in a programming language. There are many
different programming languages. Lightbot uses a symbolic language where
you use icons to create a program. In the following we are going to
write code using Python instead. However, the principles you learned by
playing Lightbot are the same. Below is an illustration of the workflow
we use when we are programming. Do you see how similar the different
steps are to the steps you performed when you played Lightbot?</p>

<p>This tutorial is brief. If you are new to programming you will need a
lot of practice. You can find a lot of tutorials online. A very
thourough one is <a class="reference external" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learning Python the hard
way</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Here we could have a list of different!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-first-program">
<h2>Your first program<a class="headerlink" href="basicProgramming.html#your-first-program" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our first program only consist of one line:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print "Hello world!"</script></div><p>When we run the code &#8220;Hello world!&#8221; is printed to the screen. This is
because we used the key word <span class="math">\(\texttt{print}\)</span>, which tells the
computer to write what follows to the screen. Notice that we use quotes
at the beginning and end of &#8220;Hello world&#8221;. This is done such that the
computer can distinguish text from code. To make it easier for the
programmer to distinguish between text and code they are shown in
different colors.</p>
<p>The text &#8220;Hello world!&#8221; is chosen arbitrarely. Try to change the text
between the quotes and see what happens!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="math">
<h2>Math<a class="headerlink" href="basicProgramming.html#math" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Python and most other computer languages the basic mathematical
operators are written as <span class="math">\(+, -, *,\)</span> and <span class="math">\(/\)</span>. In python
exponentials are expressed by a double asterisk (<span class="math">\(*\)</span><span class="math">\(*\)</span>)
notation. Lets show some examples:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print 2 + 3
print 2 - 3
print 2*3
print 2/3
print 2**3</script></div><p>When we run the code the results are just as expected apart from the
division. The reason why 2 divided by 3 is zero will be described in the
section below about types.</p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> The following shoud be part of and if/else section.</p>
<p>Other useful operators are greater-than (&gt;), less-than (&lt;),
greater-than-equal (&gt;=), and less-than-equal (&lt;=).</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print 7 > 5
print 7 >= 7
print 7 < 5
print 7 <= 5</script></div><p>If we ask this as a question: Is 7 bigger than 5? You can answer either
yes or no. In other words the assertion may be true or false, which is
what you see on the screen when you run the program. Play around, try
various combinations, and guess the result!</p>
<p>Finally, we can improve the print command such that the output is easier
to read:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print "2 + 3 = ", 2+3
print "2 < 3 = ", 2<3</script></div><p>As before we put quotes around the part that should be interpreted as
text, after the text we add a comma and then we continue writing the
math. The numbers and mathematical operators will be interpreted as code
when we execute our program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="variables">
<h2>Variables<a class="headerlink" href="basicProgramming.html#variables" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>Variables are names we give in our program such that the computer
remember the variable and we can use it later in our program. Here is an
example</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>name = "Jonas"
age = 23</script></div><p>In the first line we create a variable called <span class="math">\(\texttt{name}\)</span>,
which contains the name Jonas. Think of the variable as an empty box
called <span class="math">\(\texttt{name}\)</span>. Then we put the name &#8216;Jonas&#8217; into the box,
which is stored in the computers memory. Similarly, the next line of
code defines a variable called <span class="math">\(\texttt{age}\)</span>, which contains the
number 23.</p>
<p>Change the variables such that they contain your name and age, then run
the program. What happened? Nothing, or at least your terminal is empty.
Python has only created the variables. If you would like to see them you
can add a <span class="math">\(\texttt{print}\)</span> command at the end of the program.</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print name
print age</script></div><p>What happens when you run the code below?</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print 'name'
print 'age'</script></div><p>Why is not the result printed to the screen &#8216;Jonas&#8217; and &#8216;23&#8217;? This is
because Python interpret the code as textstrings and not as variables
when you use quotes.</p>
<p>Note that if you try to create two variables with the same name, the
first variable will be overwritten by the second. So what will happen
when you run the code below?</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>name = 'Marius'
name = 'Lise'

print name</script></div></div>
<div class="section" id="types">
<h2>Types<a class="headerlink" href="basicProgramming.html#types" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>By now you learned that variables have a name and a content, but they
also have another property namely a <span class="math">\(\texttt{type}\)</span>. When Python
creates a variable it identifies the type of the content. In the last
example we created the variable name, which contains a text string and
age which contains a number. Python remember this information;
<span class="math">\(\texttt{name}\)</span> is a text string and <span class="math">\(\texttt{age}\)</span> is a
number.</p>
<p>To check which type a variable has we can use the command
<span class="math">\(\texttt{type}\)</span>. Here is an example:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>location = 'Oslo'
year = 2015
day = 'April 29'
temperature = 8.7

print type(location)
print type(year)
print type(day)
print type(temperature)</script></div><p>In this program we first create four variables then the type of each
variable is printed. The results show that location and day has the type
&#8216;str&#8217;, which is an abbreviation for string. The variable year has the
type &#8216;int&#8217;, which means that it is an integer. Finally, temperature has
the type &#8216;float&#8217;. Thus python distinguishes between floats and integer.
In the section about mathematical operators we got zero when we divided
2 by 3. This is because both 2 and 3 have the type &#8216;int&#8217; and therefore
also the result will have the type &#8216;int&#8217;. If we use float numbers
instead we get the expected answer. Here is an example to show the
difference:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>a = 2.0
b = 3.0

c = 2
d = 3

print a/b
print c/d
print type(a/b)
print type(c/d)
print type(b/c)</script></div><p>In the last line we divide a float by an integer. Note that the result
has the type <span class="math">\(\mathit{float}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lists">
<h2>Lists<a class="headerlink" href="basicProgramming.html#lists" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>Until now you have learned that variables has a name, a content, and a
type. Now it is time to introduce a different type of variables: lists.
If we want our program to remember the names of all the students in a
class. We can create one variable for each student or we can create one
variable containing all the students. The latter is called a list and
here is an example:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>students = ['Jake', 'John', 'Mary', 'Lucy', 'Alexander']</script></div><p>Here we have used square brackets to define a list, and within the
brackets we have written 5 names separated by a comma. Further, every
name is defined as a string. When you have defined a list you can print
it and check the type:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print students
print type(students)</script></div><p>You can also check how many elements there is in your list by typing</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print len(students)</script></div><div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>lists_in_lists = [[0,1,2], ["Mary", "Lucy", "Jake"]]</script></div><p>After we have defined a list such as students</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>students = ['Jake', 'John', 'Mary', 'Lucy', 'Alexander']</script></div><p>We can access the elements in the list through the index of every
element:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print students[0]
print students[3]</script></div><p>Here <span class="math">\(\texttt{students[0]}\)</span> means the first element in the list,
which is &#8216;Jake&#8217;, while <span class="math">\(\texttt{students[3]}\)</span> is the 4th element
in the list, which is &#8216;Lucy&#8217;. Note that Python starts counting at zero!
This might seem strange, but it is just a definition we have to get used
to.</p>
<p>If we want to we can also change the elements within the list. If it
turns out that we made a mistake and &#8216;Alexander&#8217; should be &#8216;Alex&#8217;. We
can overwrite the 5th element in the list as follows</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>students[4] = 'Alex'
print students</script></div><p>When we print the list we see that the last element is changed, just as
we wanted.</p>
<p>It is also possible to add elements to the list. For instance if we
forgot one of the students in the class you can add her by typing</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>students.append('Karen')
print students</script></div><p>When we add items to a list they always appear at the end.</p>
<p>In some cases it makes sense to create and empty list and then add
elements afterwards. Here is a list, which is initially empty and then
filled with numbers</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>growing_list = []
growing_list.append(1)
growing_list.append(2)
growing_list.append(3)
print growing_list</script></div></div>
<div class="section" id="arrays">
<h2>Arrays<a class="headerlink" href="basicProgramming.html#arrays" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="section" id="loops">
<h2>Loops<a class="headerlink" href="basicProgramming.html#loops" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>A loop is a piece of code which repeat itself. If we want our program to
perform the same task many times in a row we need a loop. There are to
types of loops, namely for-loops and while-loops. Here we are only
considering <span class="math">\(\texttt{for}\)</span>-loops.</p>
<p>A for-loop repeats a piece of code for every element in a list. Again we
use the list with students. Now we want to print the names and how many
characters each name has:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>students = ["Mary", "James", "Siri" , "Alexander", "Elizabeth"]

for name in students:
    print "The name", name, "has", len(name), "characters"</script></div><p>The code is executed for every name in the list, i.e., since the list
has 5 elements the code is exectuted 5 times.</p>
<p>The first line <span class="math">\(\texttt{for name in students:}\)</span> creates a loop
over all elements in the list <span class="math">\(\texttt{students}\)</span>. In each pass of
the loop, the variable <span class="math">\(\texttt{name}\)</span> refers to an element in the
list, starting with <span class="math">\(\texttt{students[0]}\)</span>, proceeding with
<span class="math">\(\texttt{students[1]}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\texttt{students[2]}\)</span>, and so on
until we reach the last element in the list.</p>
<p>The <span class="math">\(\texttt{for}\)</span> loop specification ends with a colon, and after
the colon comes a block of statements that does something useful with
current element. Note that the block must be intended, this is an
important feature in Python. This might be difficult to remember, but
you will get used to it.</p>
<p>Here is antother example where we are adding the number from 1 to 10:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>s = 0
for i in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]:
    s += i

print s</script></div><p>If we want to loop over the numbers 1 to 1000 instead it will take long
to write down the list of numbers. Fortunately, there is a function
called <span class="math">\(\texttt{range}\)</span> in Python, which can do this job for you.
Range takes two arguments (<span class="math">\(\texttt{range(start, stop)}\)</span>) and
returns a list of numbers (integers) from start to stop. Here is to
examples:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print range(1, 10)
print range(2,8)</script></div><p>Note that the last number is not included! We may also add a third
argument, this argument tells us how large the step between the numbers
should be. Here is a few examples:</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>print range(1, 10, 1)
print range(1, 10, 2)
print range(1, 10, 3)</script></div><p><span class="math">\(\texttt{range}\)</span> is very useful in our <span class="math">\(\texttt{for}\)</span> loop</p>
<div class='sage'><script type='text/x-sage'>s = 0
for i in range(1, 1000,1):
    s += i
print s</script></div></div>
